The important ones being local storage persistence, CSS, Chrome Dev Tools, and all of the skills included in all prior projects. The goal of this browser game is to make it to the last level using the dev tools to help you make it through. This game is designed for those with prior dev exp[erience. Have a go if you like, but the last level is almost impossible without instruction! Good luck.","contributors":"Saul Greene, Michael Treat, Carlo Santos, Kevin Schmidt"},{"title":"Bus Mall","img":"assets/busMallPic.png","description":"This was one of my projects in week 2. Here we didnt focus as much on HTML/CSS as we did JS functionality. This page prompts you to click your favorite product at which point it will prompt you 25 more times. After 25 selections you are presented with the popularity of the products based on clicks as a percentage of the times the picture was shown since the program populkates 3 random images without immediate repeats. This is displayed nicely with ChartsJS and keeps a running tally/average of everyiones votes (only uses local storage).","date":"2.20.17","contributors":"Saul Greene","link":"https://saulgreene.github.io/bus-mall/"},
